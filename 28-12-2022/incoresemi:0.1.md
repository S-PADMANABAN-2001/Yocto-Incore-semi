### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

You can now run &apos;bitbake &lt;target&gt;&apos;

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-full-cmdline
    core-image-sato
    core-image-weston
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like &apos;runqemu qemux86-64&apos;.

Other commonly useful commands are:
 - &apos;devtool&apos; and &apos;recipetool&apos; handle common recipe tasks
 - &apos;bitbake-layers&apos; handles common layer tasks
 - &apos;oe-pkgdata-util&apos; handles common target package tasks
